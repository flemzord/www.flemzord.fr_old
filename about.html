<p>This is a simple Jekyll theme, that is derived from the one I use on <a href="https://www.sheevaboite.fr">my blog</a>. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at : <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb.com</a></p>

<p>You can find the source code for this theme at : <a href="https://github.com/jbleuzen/sheekyll">https://github.com/jbleuzen/sheekyll</a></p>

<p>Please don't criticize the code much, initially it was just a quick and dirty mockup and it ended as the theme I use for almost 2 years now. But as two people asked if could share it, it landed on Github.</p>
