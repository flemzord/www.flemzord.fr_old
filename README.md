#sheekyll


Sheekyll is a very basic theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), inspired by the original theme on [my blog](https://www.sheevaboite.fr). 

I had request to share it, so here it comes.

The theme is based on [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) without other dependencies, it's simple, lightweight, responsive and focus on the content first.
